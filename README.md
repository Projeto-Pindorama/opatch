# opatch 

The ``patch``(1) implementation from OpenBSD, verbatim and portabilized per
[``baiacu.h``](./baiacu.h).  

## Why?

As always, competition is good, principally if it's offering more freedom,
and I didn't want to compile {stripped-,}lobase just for a single command.

## Where does it run?

Theoretically every Linux system and, of course, BSD.

## Licence

[BSD 2-Clause](./LICENSE.txt), but it varies from file to file.  
Copycenter licences in general.
